# ScEnSor-Kit-Script

_NOTE._ This script was used to analyse data coming from the BioLector I. Example of the script output can be found here: 

Getting started:

1. Check the data organisation in the example file provided here ().
2. Download the script and place it in the same folder of the file to be analysed. The file name should end with "Analysis" and should be a .xlsx file. Changes in the script can be made to import other file formats.
3. Re-arrange the excel file. In a sheet called "Data", transfer the raw data. In a sheet named "layout", assign the variables associated to each well (strain, biosensor, medium, etc.).
4. Open the script and follow directions. 
5. Make changes upon need (replace grouping variables, etc.).
